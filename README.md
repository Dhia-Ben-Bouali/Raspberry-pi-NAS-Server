# Raspberry-pi-NAS-Server
🚀 Just completed a home NAS deployment project using Raspberry Pi + OpenMediaVault!

In this project, I transformed a Raspberry Pi 4 into a fully functional Network Attached Storage (NAS) system with centralized, secure, and remote-accessible file sharing.

🔍 Key steps included:

Scanning the network with nmap to locate the Pi

Setting up SSH access and updating the system

Installing OpenMediaVault (OMV) from the official GitHub script

Configuring and mounting an external drive (exFAT)

Creating shared folders with user-level access control

Enabling SMB/CIFS for Windows network access

Adding firewall rules to restrict access to local devices only

Troubleshooting lockout and restoring WebUI access via SSH

🔒 I also explored basic security hardening by managing firewall rules and planning future improvements like encrypted shares and monitoring tools.

📄 I've written a technical report summarizing the entire process, including screenshots and detailed steps — feel free to check it out if you're curious about DIY NAS setups, home labs, or OpenMediaVault!
